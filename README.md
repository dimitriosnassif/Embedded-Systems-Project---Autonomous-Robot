**Objective**: The robot must perform tests by detecting objects in its immediate environment.

Team `construction of a hardware and software system` based on a microcontroller board. The technical concepts covered cover familiarization with the hardware and software elements and `the interactions required for the realization and understanding of a simple computer system`, but complete with its inputs/outputs and peripherals. `Programming at different levels`, `configuration management`, `code inspections and testing`, and basic programming practices are gradually introduced.
